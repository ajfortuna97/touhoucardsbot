# touhoucardsbot
Our own server's replacement to the BullyBot (RIP) that used to give us electronic trading cards. Now with 100% more gacha. I'm serious.

Really thought, this project began a little something like this:
> BullyBot makes an announcement (likely through developer) that it's being decomissioned rather abruptly

> Well there go our trading cards and the system in general

> Not that I really did a lot of collecting or knew who was even on the cards

> But come on, who doesn't like trading cards?

> Everyone wonders what we're going to do from now on

> ...

> Me: "Well, why don't I make one?"

> "Shouldn't be that hard to replicate the functions, plus we can add any custom features we'd like."

> "I also should go put MySQL back on my desktop since that got lost when I switched to my SSD."

> Everyone Else: "Wait you can do that?"

And so, here we are, with me attempting to add in features like:
* A gacha system! Everyone loves this, right? Makes tons of money in mobile games, except not here since uh I think I might get in trouble for that.
* A random chance to get free cards! It's only like 1/1000 though!
* Anti-spam protection, by allowing your 1/1000 chance to get a free card only occur every 2 minutes tops!
* And any additional features we decide to come up with as I try to code this

I'll list the full set of characters on the trading cards when I get the database fully up and running, since until all tables are created it's prone to change.
